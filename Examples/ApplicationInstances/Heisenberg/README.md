# Heisenberg Model
The Jupyter notebooks in this directory walk through several resource analysis tasks for the Heisenberg model.  Target algorithms include qubitized quantum dynamics (via QSP/QET/QSVT) and qubitized ground-state energy estimation (GSEE).


## Notebook Summaries
### heisenberg-dynamics-qubitized.ipynb
This notebook introduces and demonstrates qubitized quantum dynamics (via QSP/QET/QSVT) for the Heisenberg model.  Topics include the generation of phase angles for quantum simulation, the construction of simulation circuits, resource analysis, and scaling estimates for larger systems. 


### heisenberg-phase_estimation.ipynb
This notebook introduces and demonstrates qubitized ground-state energy estimation for the Heisenberg model.  Topics include the construction of simulation circuits, resource analysis, and scaling estimates for larger systems.
