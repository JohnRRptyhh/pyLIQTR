Example notebooks:

- double_factorized_encoding_and_phase_estimation.ipynb: In this notebook, we walk through the steps for taking a catalyst as described by an fcidump file, generating a ProblemInstance, block encoding it using the DoubleFactorized algorithm, and estimating resources for the resulting qubitized phase estimation circuit. Printing the circuit to qasm is demonstrated at the end.
