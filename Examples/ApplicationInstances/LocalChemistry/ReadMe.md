This directory contains an example of how the ChemicalHamiltonian `ProblemInstance` is implemented for small molecules. The notebook `ChemicalHamiltonian_Example` shows how to create an instance, either from our provided list of molecules (details found in `chemistry_instances.csv`) or from molecular parameters including geometry, charge, multiplicity, and basis. It then goes through generating a `BlockEncoding` to create a qubitized phase estimation circuit, along with performing resource estimation for the circuit.
