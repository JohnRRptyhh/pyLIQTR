# Nonlinear Ordinary Differential Equations

## Notebook Summaries
### carleman_encoding_details.ipynb
This notebook details the block encoding technique developed by Parker Kuklinski and Benjamin Rempfer for Carleman Linearization. After reviewing its contents one should be able to generate the circuitry required (as QASM, a cirq circuit object, or a qualtran bloq object) to encode a Carleman matrix given some initial parameters. Some asmytotic bounds are explored qualitatively while their analytical counterparts are under development in a manuscript in preparation.
