Example notebooks:

- problem_setup.ipynb: In this notebook, we detail how to use `PEST`, a Julia package, to generate periodic electronic structure Hamiltonian coefficients. This includes tuning parameters which control the system size in terms of the number of basis elements.

- problem_instance_and_encoding.ipynb: This notebook walks through how to block encode and perform resource analysis for periodic electronic structure Hamiltonians generated using `PEST`. This includes initializing an ElectronicStructure(ProblemInstance) instance and encoding it with the LinearT algorithm based on ["Encoding Electronic Spectra in Quantum Circuits with Linear T Complexity"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.03662). The inputs for this notebook can be created following the steps in `problem_setup.ipynb`.

- resource_estimates-electronic_structure-mg_slab.ipynb: This notebook uses `pyLIQTR` to generate explicit resource estimates for ground state energy estimation of the magnesium slab, a particular periodic electronic structure system, with coefficients expressed in the dual plane-wave basis. This builds on `problem_instance_and_encoding.ipynb` by using the encoding to build a qubitized walk operator. This notebook also demonstrates how to extrapolate resource counts to large scale systems.
