To generate the coefficients for each example using `PEST`, we need a set of coordinates that describe the atoms in a \"supercell\" and a vector containing the vacuum padding between periodic images (see Figure below). Here, we choose an orthorhombic supercell for which the atomic coordinates, expressed in units of Angstrom, are contained in an xyz file. For the padding, we use a uniform 10 Angstroms for the sake of simplicity. See [pest-intro](../../PEST/pest-intro.ipynb) for details on how to determine the padding based on physical considerations.\n",

We can see details of the grid based on our chosen parameters in the print out. In particular, note the line `Grid = ...` which tells us the number of basis elements along each dimension and the resulting total number of basis elements. Note, for later block encodings, it is important that there are 3 or more elements along each dimension, ie `Grid = 3 x 3 x 3`, and that the grid is a cube. These constraints can be met by changing `E_cut_off`. Increasing `E_cut_off` will increase the overall basis size, and decreasing it will decrease the basis size."
