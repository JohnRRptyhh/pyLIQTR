# PEST
The Jupyter notebooks in this directory walk through the use of pyLIQTR's Electronic Structure Tools (PEST).  This Julia-based framework can generate electronic structure Hamiltonians in a dual plane-wave basis.


## Notebook Summaries
### pest-intro.ipynb
Provides a detailed introduction to PEST for Hamiltonian generation

### pest-python.ipynb
Demonstrates how PEST Hamiltonians can be handled in a Python-based workflow.
