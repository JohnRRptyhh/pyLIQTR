The required inputs are (1) a set of atomic coordinates for a given material or molecule; (2) a description of the supercell geometry for a periodic system; and (3) cutoffs that specify the number of basis functions that are to be constructed using a $k$-point mesh or real-space grid:\n",

    "\n",
    "There are three common basis schemes for electronic structure calculations.  We  can be broadly classify these according to the real-space locality of their basis elements.  Local basis sets are generally defined using Gaussian or exponentially decaying functions (termed Gaussian and Slater-type orbitals, respectively)  and introduced as isolated atomic orbitals. This  arrangement is particularly natural for aperiodic systems or single molecules.  Following this logic, nonlocal  bases are often efficient for periodic or spatially-extended systems.  <b>Plane waves (PW)</b> are a popular choice for this case, and they may be supplemented with <i>pseudopotentials</i> that average out unimportant features and reduce the required basis size.  This partition is not strict $-$ isolated molecules can be described using plane waves provided that we introduce interstitial \"vacuum padding\" between periodic images.  However, there may be  tradeoffs in overhead due to an  inefficient description of the underlying physics.\n",

    "<center>\n",
    "<img src=\"./figures/fig-wavefunctions.png\" width=800>\n",
    "</center>\n",
    "\n",
    "Other arrangements can bridge this partition.  Mixed bases such as Gaussian plane-waves (GPWs) have intermediate locality and exhibit robust performance for many systems.  Another intermediate strategy is derived from the Fourier transform of a plane-wave scheme, which  gives a corresponding <b>dual plane-wave (DPW)</b> basis.  These have intermediate locality in both real-space and momentum-space (conversely, plane-waves are nonlocal in real-space and local in momentum-space).  Notably, the underlying DPW functions are centered on the vertices of a regular, real-space grid as opposed to being fully spatially extended.  This arrangement can deliver high efficiency for certain electronic structure problems, such as those involving surfaces or bulk materials.  DPWs also provide  an efficient factorization of second-quantized Hamiltonians, ultimately enabling fault-tolerant ground-state estimation algorithms with linear $T$-complexity in problem scale. While the size of a PW basis is fixed by a cutoff $E_\\text{cut}$ for the highest-energy plane wave states, the size of a DPW basis is determined by the spacing $a_0$ between real-space grid points.  There is a direct correspondence between these measures, which we discuss below, that allows us to extrapolate classical PW benchmarks to DPWs. A more comprehensive description of these methods is found in [1,2].  \n",

    "The PEST code is well-suited to periodic systems.  However, these methods can also be used for isolated molecules with minor modifications. The required inputs are uniformly (i) a set of coordinates that describe the atoms in a \"supercell\" and (ii) a set of vectors that specify the geometry of this cell.  In this context, a supercell is simply the minimal repeating unit that is explicitly described by our calculations.  This can range from the unit cell of a bulk material to a large slab  that supports surface reactions.  The cell vectors define the extent of this periodic unit along a fixed set of orthorhombic axes (other cells are a work in progress).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "  The size of a supercell is determined by the physical problem as well as the desired level of computational detail.  For instance, this cell must accommodate all chemical reactants, key material features, and  any encapsulating solvent (if needed).  There is also an interplay between the cell contents and the basis scheme, particularly with regard to quantitative accuracy. For instance, a minimal supercell $-$ containing only one unit cell of some material $-$ would mandate a fine $k$-point mesh when using plane-wave basis.  This dense mesh is required to properly sample states throughout the Brillouin zone.  The analogous dual plane-wave calculations require a supercell containing many repeated unit cells in order to accommodate extended electronic states and avoid self-interaction artifacts between periodic images.\n",

    "Most chemical systems (or a close analogue) have been benchmarked using plane-wave density functional theory (DFT).  A key quantity is the converged PW energy cutoff $E_\\text{cut}$, which ultimately determines the size of our basis set.  However, this is only part of the story $-$ classical methods generally use pseudopotentials to eliminate unimportant yet computationally expensive features.  These reduce the required energy cutoffs to the order of 10-100 Ry instead of a prohibitive  $10^5-10^6$ Ry that would  otherwise be required.  \n",
    " \n",
    " Our implementation follows the \"pure\" PW/DPW approach from the quantum algorithms in  [1,2] and does not (yet) account for pseudopotentials.  Using  pseudpotential-derived cutoffs with our code will give inaccurate values for some Hamiltonian coefficients.  However, `PEST` will  generate the correct operator terms and hence facilitate robust resource estimates.  This is not unduly speculative, since the formal correspondence PWs and DPWs will, in principle, allow us to construct a pseudopotential-based quantum algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "Low $T$-complexity quantum algorithms require a dual plane-wave basis in lieu of the plane-wave arrangement discussed above.  Fortunately, the duality between PWs and DPWs also allows us to specify an equivalent dual grid spacing:\n",

The factor $\\gamma$ specifies if we sample at this wavelength ($\\gamma = 1.0$) or half of this wavelength ($\\gamma = 0.5$).  An ideal value would depend on pseudopotential details, though likely this would be closer to $\\gamma = 0.5$.  Thus, this expression gives us a robust means to specify DPW grids in terms of a classical reference with prescribed accuracy.\n"

    "It is important to qualify our approximations from the outset.  First and foremost we restrict to the adiabatic limit â that is, where electron dynamics substantially outpace those of the heavier nuclei (aka \"ions\"). This is accomplished by invoking the Born-Oppenheimer approximation, which is suitable for a broad range of static and quasi-static problems. A more comprehensive approach might go beyond this restriction and treat non-adiabatic dynamics. That is not attempted here.\n",
    "\n",
    "A second limitation is our definitions originate from a <b>nonlocal, all-electron plane wave (PW) basis</b> expansion. This level of detail is both unnecessary and intractable for most calculations of matter under non-extreme conditions.  The  problem is that the sharp potential near atomic nuclei will induce rapid wavefunction oscillations in their vicinity (the so-called \"nuclear cusp\").  These, in turn, require the inclusion of very high-frequency basis modes and thus a high energy cutoff (or a very fine real-space grid).  Classical electronic electronic codes generally avoid this issue by using pseudopotentials to smooth the nuclear potential and mitigate these oscillations.  The end result is that we can use a much lower energy cutoff and thus a smaller basis.\n",
    "\n",
    "While a DPW representation has not been formalized for pseudopotential methods, it will be related to its plane-wave counterpart by a Fourier transform (in practice there are some other subtleties, e.g., regarding norm-conservation, etc.).  We will ignore these complications to first order, and assume that a given plane-wave pseudopotential cutoff $E_\\text{cut}$ will map directly to a real-space grid spacing $a_0$. Other basis expansions could also be used (wavelets, inhomogeneous grids), though the tradeoffs inherent to each remain an open question.\n",
